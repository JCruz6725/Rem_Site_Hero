## Rapid Deployment

~~For rapid deployment link this project to a Heroku app~~

## Over all design

The over all approach to this portfolio projecgt is base off of a microservices architecture. Although this architecture is overkill for a simple portfolio its purpose is to demonstrate the capacity to apply complex concepts.

need to build the picture that show the architecture and the tranfer of data between lossely coupled applications.

Although I could have taken the easier approach and only put together a frontend with the highlights embedded
